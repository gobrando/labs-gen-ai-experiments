# GenAI Product Performance Testing Experiments

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive performance testing and analysis experiments for the Goodwill Central Texas Referral GenAI product. These experiments were conducted to optimize model selection, parameter configuration, and understand web search behavior in the OpenAI Responses API.

## Key Findings Summary

### 1. Model Selection (Phase 1)
- **Winner: Gemini 3 Flash** - 2.15x faster than ChatGPT 5.1
- ChatGPT 5.1: 29.72s avg, 100% success rate, high variability (σ=7.73s)
- Gemini 3 Flash: 13.80s avg, 98.2% success rate, very consistent (σ=1.23s)
- At scale (1,000 requests): Gemini saves 4.4 hours

### 2. Parameter Effect Testing (Phase 2)
**Temperature (0.0-2.0):**
- Web search rate: Stable ~90% across all values
- Minimal effect on behavior
- Temperature 2.0 showed instability (hung queries)

**Reasoning (low, medium, high):**
- Web search rate: 90% → 90% → 95% → 100% (increases with reasoning level)
- Latency: ~20s → ~40s → ~140s → ~280s (dramatically slower)
- Higher reasoning = MORE web search + MUCH slower responses
- Reasoning high had reliability issues (4 connection errors)

**Production Recommendation:**
Keep gpt-5.1 with reasoning="none" for optimal performance:
- Fastest response times (~20s median)
- Most reliable (no hung queries)
- Lowest cost (no reasoning overhead)
- Stable web search behavior

### 3. Web Search Behavior Analysis
**Production Baseline:**
- Real production: 36.4% web search rate (with full database resources)
- Test environment: 90-100% web search rate (CAT/Excel resources only)
- 60pp gap due to missing ~hundreds of database-injected resources

**Root Cause:**
- Database resources are injected into system prompt at runtime
- Test scripts use static prompt with only CAT/Excel resources
- Model correctly uses web search when database resources unavailable

## Methodology

### Testing Approach
1. **Real Production Queries:** Used 55 actual production queries from live system
2. **Controlled Environment:** Isolated variables (model, temperature, reasoning)
3. **Statistical Rigor:** Used median latency to handle outliers, tracked error rates
4. **Baseline Establishment:** Measured production behavior first for comparison

### OpenAI Responses API
- API: `client.responses.create()`
- Web search detection: `response.output` items with `type='web_search_call'`
- Model: gpt-5.1
- Parameters tested: temperature (0.0-2.0), reasoning (none, low, medium, high)

### Production Context
- Phoenix tracing: Production observability at phoenix.referral-pilot-dev.navateam.com:6006
- Database resources: ~Hundreds of resources injected at runtime (not in static prompt)
- System prompt: Jinja2 template with runtime variable injection

## Production Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Keep current configuration:** gpt-5.1 with reasoning="none"
2. **Don't use higher reasoning levels:** Dramatically slower with minimal benefit
3. **Temperature parameter:** Not significant for this use case, keep at default

### Future Considerations
1. **Model comparison with web search:** Test Gemini with web search capability
2. **Database resource optimization:** Analyze which injected resources are most valuable
3. **Prompt engineering:** Further optimize prompt to reduce unnecessary web searches

## Relationship to Decision Records

These experiments support the following decision records that should be included in the main product repo:

### Decision Record: Model Selection and Configuration

**Context:** Need to optimize API response times and cost while maintaining quality

**Decision:** Use gpt-5.1 with reasoning="none" for production

**Consequences:**
- Fastest median response time (~20s)
- Most cost-effective configuration
- Stable and reliable behavior
- Future opportunity to test Gemini 3 Flash if web search support is added

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Higher reasoning levels: 2-14x slower, unreliable, minimal benefit
- Temperature variations: No significant impact on behavior
- Gemini 3 Flash: 2x faster but lacks web search capability needed for production

## Test Environment

- **Python:** 3.x
- **Dependencies:** openai, httpx, json, time
- **APIs:** OpenAI Responses API, Phoenix tracing API
- **Date Range:** 2026-03-03 (testing period)
